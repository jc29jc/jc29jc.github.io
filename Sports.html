    <h1>SPORTS</h1>
    <p>This page will contain the sports I play and more about them</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Golf</li>
        <p>Golf, which is most likely my main sport, is a sport I play. I am a 15 year old golfer from Marin,
            California. I have some good background in golf. I started golf around 5 with my dad, but just seriously got
            into it about 2 years ago. I used to attend Hall Middle School, where my golf team won the school tournament
            by one stroke, in 8th grade. Currently, I am a 7 handicap in USGA GHIN. My home courses inculde Peacock Golf
            Club, Mcginnis Golf Club, and StoneTree CC. I am currently a Freshamn in High School, working forward to my
            goal to making the golf team, which only holds 10 players in the entire school.</p>
        <li>Soccer</li>
        <p>Soccer, which is also up there for my main sport, is also a sport I play. My background in soccer comes from
            my first club, MV. I played there until 6th grade, which then I transfered to CMSC, where I currently play
            now. We play in ECNL RL league. MY main position is all over the midfield weather its the 6, the 8, or the
            10. I also play right wing back. For my highschool team, I am a Freshamn at Redwood HS, playing on JV.
            Currently we re 2-0, and are tied for first in our league.</p>
        <li>Football</li>
        <p>Football is another sport I play. This year I played for Redwood Football, where I played WR and Safety. Our
            team started of 3-0, but hten went on a streak 0f 0-4-2, which then we won our last game, placing us at 500
            with a record of 4-4-2. The ex[erience of Freshamn football is something that I would kill to do again, and I totally recomend for future freshamn to do it.</p>
