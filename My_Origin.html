    <h1>Origin</h1>
    <p>This page will contain where I am from, my family's backstory, and my religion</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My mom</li>
        <P>My mom and her side of the family was born in Russia, Saint Petersberg. When she moved to the US, she was 14,
            her parents were 34 and her brother was 3. She moved to the USA because of Anti-semitism in Russia. When she
            moved here, she had know idea how to fit in, and nor did her parents. She didnt speak English, and her
            parents didnt either. For money, her Dad cleaned houses, and her mom taught music, as they slowly started
            fitting in. My mom and her brother both went to TL. As she grew up, she contiued to fit in, making more and
            more friends, and then she met my dad.</P>
        <li>My dad</li>
        <P>My dad had more of a sad backstory. He grew up in the USA as a family of five. Two sisters and one twin. His
            dad was a racecar driver and built cars, which got him into doing stuf like that. But, unfortanently, when
            he was 18, his dad died from cancer and his mom for a heart attack. His grandparents had already passed, so
            it left him with his twin sister, and not the other one because of a bad relationship. He powered through
            it, and went to SDSU where he met so many friends. 10 years later, he met my mom.</P>
