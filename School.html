    <h1>SCHOOL</h1>
    <p>This page will contain my school life as a Freshamn at redwood</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My favorite subject</li>
        <p>My favorite subject for me is science. SCience really interests me. I like to learn about the origin of the
            universe, and overall how the unvierse works and its elements</p>
        <li>My least favorite subject</li>
        <P>My least favorite subject has to be math, or a subject called life lab where we learn about the human body,
            the effect of drugs, or etc. The reason for this is because I just find both of the subjects very confusing,
            hard, and boring or not interesting.</P>
        <li>Sports I play</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Football</li>
            <li>Soccer</li>
