        <li>Skiing</li>
        <p>Other than sports I actually play competitively, skiing is one of my favorite hobbies. I consider myself as a
            very good skiier. My main resort I go to is Squaw Valley or Palisades. I like this resort because of some of
            its hard terrain. This include KT22, fingers which is a big cliff drop, and one of the hardest terrains in
            the world, Eagles Nest. </p>

        <P>Yes, golf is one of my main sports, but I also do consider it a hobby. I love to play with a group of friends
